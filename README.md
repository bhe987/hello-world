# hello-world
This repository is a tutorial one, and I'm learning how to use Github.
I'm currently a computer science student at Auburn University, and I am planning on switching my major into Software Engineering going into the Fall semester of my sophomore year.
I am going to become part of the Auburn University Small Satellite Program, and we will, as a collaborative effort with students from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, have a satellite in space by 2018.
